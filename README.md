## Mindfulness Emotional Trail - Project for Virtual Reality Class

### How it works
- M.E.T. was developed with the Oculus Quest in mind
  - Start of game
  - The player spawns  in front of the main maneu
  - Movement is done with the left joystick
  - The player can move around the area, but cannot access the trail until they click “Go on a Walk’ option on the main menu.
  - Other options: Controls, Credits, Quit
- On the trail
  - Movement is still done with the left joystick
  - Player can quit at any time using the B button
- “Meditation spots”
  - Certain spots that are colored blue that activate when the player enters them
  - Pops up an activity for the player to do
  - When the player is done or leaves the spot, spot is colored pink
  - Can return to spot and re-do activity
- Ending the walk
  - When player has done all of the activities, the prompt to end the walk shows up (A button)
  - The player has the the choice to continue walking or re-do activities
  - When the player presses A: game resets

### Limitations and Future Additions
- Limitations
  - Couldn’t figure out how to make player stay in place when in meditation spot
  - Game is not as realistic as real life
  - Not a real walk. User must use joysticks to move and look around, defeating the meaning of “Go On A Walk”
- Future Additions
  - Randomize mindfulness popups
  - Larger variety in environment (not solely trees)
